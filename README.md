# Custom GPT Code
The code to develop the custom GPT can be found within the folder CustomGPTCode. This code has been divided into 3 subfolders. The scripts that has to do with dataset manipulation can be found in DatasetMakerScripts. The scripts to perform the statistical analysis of the results can be found the folder StasticalAnalyis, and the code surrounding tokenization and the training of the models can be found within CustomGPTCode/CustomGPTCode. 
# Datasets
The datasets used to train the custom GPT models on can be found in the folder Datasets. The final dataset was dataset_10
# Final custom model
The metadata regarding the final custom GPT model can be found in FinalCustomGPTModel. We could not fit the entire model within Git, so it can be found in the following drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HBXRxNxdS9-xeNlRiP9mWLjifbZZP1o/view?usp=sharing
# Fine tuned model
The code required to generate the Q and A pairs to finetune the GPT can be found in FineTunedGPTCode.
# Rails implentation.
The implementation of the GUI in Rails can be found in RubyOnRailsImplementation.
